# Efficient typescript generator

This project is a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator for Typescript project. The aim is to bootstrap several kinds of application based on Javascript, but written in Typescript. This project is very new, the number of options will definitely grow.

# Current generation

Simple node project bootstrap to work with [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) with linting through [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) and unit testing through [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html)

# Next steps

* [Basic project] Add nodemon to monitor and refresh some tasks
